# swapfund
SwapFund is a decentralized crytpocurrency fund allowing users to easily swap and control their own coins.

#Structure

1. NOCODE Bubble.io for landing page
2. Single page interface, hosted by server

#How it works
1. User has 1 BNB
2. Chooses what fund (10,100,1000 coins)
3. Use 1Inch API to swap all coins individually and send each coin back to wallet (DECENTRALIZED COIN OWNERSHIP)
4. Contract/website saves address so user can swap all coins back
