# swapfund
SwapFund is a decentralized crytpocurrency fund allowing users to easily swap and control their own coins.

#Structure

1. NOCODE Bubble.io for landing page
2. Single page interface, hosted by server

#How it works
1. User has 1 BNB
2. Chooses what fund (10,100,1000 coins)
3. Use 1Inch API to swap all coins individually and send each coin back to wallet (DECENTRALIZED COIN OWNERSHIP)
4. Contract/website saves address so user can swap all coins back

#TO DO 
Everything lol
1. Create functionality for interface in BSC test with javascript,html,etc. TEST
2. Create functionality with nodejs 
3. Create token for gas? TEST
4. Create landing page
5. Put it all together

#Tokenomics
1. Coin for gas to be used for gas fees 
2. Buy incentive: when you buy into fund, you get our token, staking(maybe minting?) will give you some back
3. Sell for gas fees


Economics 
1. I send 1 BNB and receive my 10 tokens, 1 being myToken
2. By holding myToken, I generate new myTokens based on my holdings (SUPPY UP/DEMAND DOWN)
3. I sell my holdings, when I send my tokens back to the contract, burn % of token that was minted?
